Some minor changes

September 17, 2004
I can change the statics module for register the user count by date...
begin 3:51
- Change the classes to directory ./classes
- Change the config.inc.php to directory ./configs
- I can't use include_once at module level because the vars are loosed 
in the execution... The correct form is use include for each module or send
the values to the templates...
- Change some in the images gallery
